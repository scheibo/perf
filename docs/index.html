      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        The desire to rank and compare performances is universal across sports, be it to answer the
        question of whether Michael Jordan or LeBron James was the better basketball player, what
        1968 Jim Ryun’s mile time would be on a modern, synthetic track, or whether Katie Ledecky’s
        or Michael Phelps’ victories were more impressive. However, accurately comparing such
        performances is difficult and error prone - in all cases we must acknowledge that we will
        never be able to come up with a definitive answer, the best we can do is come up with
        metrics to guide the discussion and add a layer of scientific nuance to arguments.
      </p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        In swimming and track and field, the governing bodies (FINA and the IAAF, respectively)
        publish ‘points’ tables which can be used to rank performances. <a
        href="https://www.fina.org/sites/default/files/fina_points_table_2.pdf">FINA’s model</a> is
        based on comparing a event performance’s time to the current world record for that event (the
        ‘base’ performance) and applying a cubic function to arrive at a points total:
      </p>
      <div class="formula">
        <span>1000 (t<sub>WR</sub> / t)<sup>3</sup></span><br /><br />
      </div>
      <p>
        The IAAF tables are based on Dr. Bojidar Spiriev’s Hungarian Scoring Table model which also
        calculates a score based on a base performance and several constants:
      </p>
      <div class="formula">
        <span>a (t - t<sub>b</sub>)<sup>c</sup></span><br /><br />
      </div>
      <p>
        Where <span class="formula">a</span>, <span class="formula">t<sub>b</sub> </span> (the base
        performance) and <span class="formula">c</span> vary based on the event. Mick Bromilow’s <a
        href="https://www.southernathletics.org.uk/assets/files/bromilowscoring.docx">“Towards a
        fairer scoring system in athletics“</a> points out some issues and suggests improvements for
        this approach, and there are numerous other systems for evaluating or predicting performance in
        athletics (<a href="http://www.cs.uml.edu/~phoffman/xcinfo3.html">Gardner-Purdy points</a>,
        <a href="http://runsmartproject.com/calculator/">Daniels’ VDOT</a>,
        <a href="https://www.mcmillanrunning.com/ ">McMillan’s calculator</a>,
        <a href="http://myweb.lmu.edu/jmureika/track/mercier/instructions.html ">Mercier Score</a>),
        as well for adjusting for <a href="http://www.cs.uml.edu/~phoffman/wind.html">wind or altitude</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Comparing road cycling performance is significantly more difficult than swimming or
        athletics - road races take place over varying terrain and venues without any standard event
        distances. Importantly, weather conditions, in particular wind, have a substantially larger
        impact on performance than in other sports due to the speeds reached during competition and
        the quadratic nature of aerodynamic drag. As such, coming up with a formula to compare any
        given cycling performance with another is a nonstarter. However, if we restrict the domain
        to just comparing cycling <em>climbing</em> performance we can minimize the impact of many
        confounding factors and come up with a rough model to use for comparison purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Comparing cycling climbing performance is not a new idea - Michele Ferrari coined <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAM_(bicycling)">VAM</a> (<em>velocità ascensionale
        media</em>) for comparing climbing speed, and Scott Richards &amp; Dr. Michael Puchowicz
        (<a href="https://veloclinic.com">Veloclinic</a>) have developed models
        (<a href="http://www.cyclismas.com/biscuits/a-different-approach-to-comparing-climbing-performances/">pVAM</a>,
        <a href="http://www.cyclismas.com/biscuits/introducing-pvgrad-yes-another-performance-meter/">pVGRAD</a>)
        for predicting climbing performance. Critics have used these models to argue whether or not a
        performance was ‘too good to be true’, but these allegations need to be taken with a grain of
        salt - the models are <a href="https://wattmatters.blog/home/2013/07/windbags.html">subject</a>

        to be able to definitively brand a rider as a doper. More recently, the trend has shifting to
        relying on more scientifically backed models for quantifying cycling climbing performances.
      </p>
      <p>
        Puchowicz’s current approach relies on <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28121252">Martin’s mathematical model</a>
        for calculating cycling power, normalized for typical weight and conditions and corrected for
        altitude using <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5362642/">Townsend’s model</a>
        which relies on <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00140136508930810">Monod and
        Scherrer’s seminal Critical Power (CP) model</a>. This can be used to calculate an estimated,
        normalized W/kg for a rider, which can then be compared to other performances of the same duration.
      </p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
      <p>
        Puchowicz’s work provides an excellent starting point for development of
        ‘<span class="formula">PERF</span>’, a formula for comparing cycling performance across various
        climbing durations. However, while Puchowicz’s approach is mainly concerned with estimating and
        comparing Tour de France climbing performances during the race, <span class="formula">PERF</span>
        aims to also rate one-off efforts by amateur cyclists. Like with FINA/IAAF points tables, a
        world class performance should rate around 1000 points, with less impressive performances
        earning progressively less points.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="formula">PERF</span> begins by deriving an altitude-adjusted estimation for
        normalized power-to-weight ratio (W/kg) based on Martin’s and Townsend’s models:
      </p>
      <div class="formula">
        <span>P<sub>AT</sub> = 1/2 ρ (C<sub>D</sub> A + F<sub>W</sub>) V<sub>a</sub><sup>2</sup> V<sub>G</sub></span><br />
        <span>P<sub>RR</sub> = V<sub>G</sub> cos[tan<sup>-1</sup>(G<sub>R</sub>)] C<sub>RR</sub> m<sub>T</sub> g</span><br />
        <span>P<sub>WB</sub> = V<sub>G</sub> (91 + 8.7 V<sub>G</sub>) / 1000</span><br />
        <span>P<sub>PE</sub> = V<sub>G</sub> m<sub>T</sub> g sin[tan<sup>-1</sup>(G<sub>R</sub>)]</span><br />
        <span>P<sub>KE</sub> = 1/2 (m<sub>T</sub> + I/r<sup>2</sup>) (V<sub>Gf</sub><sup>2</sup> - V<sub>Gi</sub><sup>2</sup>) / (t<sub>i</sub> - t<sub>f</sub>) </span><br />
